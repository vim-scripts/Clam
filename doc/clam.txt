1. Usage                                                           *ClamUsage*

The :Clam command is your point of entry to Clam.  Use it to run a shell
command like this: >

    :Clam ls -l

This will open up a new vertical split with the results of the command in it.
You can edit the text in this split like any other buffer.

When you close the buffer with :quit or something similar Clam will place your
cursor back in the split you came from.

You might want to set up your own mapping to make Clam easier to use.  The
author has something like this in his .vimrc: >

    nnoremap ! :Clam<space>

That's Clam in a nutclamshell.

2. Mappings                                                     *ClamMappings*

Clam also defines two special mappings in the command output window for your
convenience.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Refresh                                                      *ClamRefresh*

Bound to: <localleader>r

"Refresh" the output by running the command again.

This is useful for commands where the output might change frequently and you
want to watch it in real time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 Pipe                                                            *ClamPipe*

Bound to: <localleader>p

"Pipe" the buffer through another command and replace the contents with its
result.

This allows you to run a shell pipeline where you can manually inspect and
massage the intermediate results.

3. License                                                       *ClamLicense*
